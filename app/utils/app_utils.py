            This middleware intercepts all incoming HTTP requests and outgoing responses,

            Args:
                request (Request): The incoming HTTP request object.
                call_next (Callable): The next middleware or endpoint to call in the request-response cycle.

            Returns:
                Response: A reconstructed HTTP response with the same content and properties as the original.

            Functionality:
                - Captures the start time of the request processing.
                - Processes the request and captures the original response.
                - Reads the response body by iterating over the response's body iterator.
                - Reconstructs the response with the captured content to ensure the response integrity is maintained.
                - Attempts to parse the response body as JSON; falls back to plain text if parsing fails.
                - Logs the following details:

                    - Processing time in seconds

            Notes:
                - Handles both JSON and plain-text response bodies.
                - Adds performance overhead due to buffering the response content.
